# I'm currently experiencing an issue with the method "simple_search()" I believe is due to the redis JSON structure. redis seems to be indexing the object keys sequentally and I'm not sure how to fix this. This is giving me a problem in "assignment3_JSON_redis.py" on line 93 as I'm not sure how to handle this structure without a constant at that level in the JSON heirarchy. Maybe I sould be importing the JSON into redis a different way and that would resolve the sequential keys?
